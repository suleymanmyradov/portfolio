#### 2. Smart Brain Face Detection App (React.js, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL)

Diving into the intersection of frontend and backend technologies, I proudly present the "Smart Brain" web application. This project is a testament to my proficiency in crafting comprehensive solutions that seamlessly bridge user experience with robust server-side operations. 

"Smart Brain" harnesses advanced image analysis through the Clarifai API, revolutionizing photo processing with real-time face detection capabilities. This application goes beyond its visual appeal by encapsulating a harmonious marriage of cutting-edge technologies.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3
  - Backend: Node.js, Express.js
  - Database: PostgreSQL
  - API: Clarifai for face detection
- **Key Features:** Real-time face detection, user authentication, image upload and processing
- **GitHub Repository of frontend:** [Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/suleymanmyradov/face-recognition)
- **GitHub Repository of Backend:** [Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/suleymanmyradov/face-recognition-api)

Witness the synergy between React.js, HTML5, and CSS3 on the frontend as they craft an engaging and user-friendly interface. Delve into the heart of the application and explore Node.js and Express.js orchestrating the backend operations. The seamless integration with PostgreSQL adds the reliability of database-driven functionalities.

The crowning jewel of "Smart Brain" is its real-time face detection prowess, powered by the Clarifai API. Users can experience the thrill of watching the app detect faces in uploaded photos instantaneously. Robust user authentication ensures data security and confidentiality.
